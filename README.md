# Stock-Predictor

Tesla Stock Predictor
This project provides a Stock Predictor for analyzing Tesla's historical stock performance. It leverages Python for data preprocessing, TensorFlow's LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time-series forecasting, and Matplotlib for data visualization. By training on historical stock data, the model predicts future closing prices for Tesla stock, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Loads and cleans Tesla stock data from a CSV file.
Normalizes data for efficient model training.
Converts data into a format suitable for time-series analysis.
LSTM Model for Prediction:

Trains an LSTM neural network to capture trends and patterns in Tesla's stock data.
Predicts future closing prices based on historical trends.
Visualization with Matplotlib:

Plots historical stock prices, training performance, and predicted values for easy interpretation.
Offers side-by-side comparisons of actual and predicted prices.
